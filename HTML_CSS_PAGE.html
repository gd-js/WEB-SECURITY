<!-- The true kings of HTML are attributes. -->
<html lang="en-US">

<!-- Comments are of spear like shape, attributes always incooperate an equal sign (=)... see more below!
The definitory rule: No equal sign, no attribute! -->

<h1>HTML is simple and a backbone of visual human computer interaction.</h1>
<h2>This is a headline H TAG which is owner of a sleek h1 label.</h2>
<h3>That was a <i>lie</i> to get you used to checking the tags.</h3>

<p><i>P TAGS in italics help you get the point with enhanced connotations within complex blocks of symantics. Usually, P TAGS are for sole paragraphs!</i></p>

<a href="#Link" title="Links are important relational elements inbetween web interfaces!">There's a text behind this link through the title attribute!</a>

<!-- The true definiton of STYLE in HTML is "selective configuration of appearance". -->
<p style="font-size: 12px; color: gold">This paragraph was engoldened through the STYLE attribute; the font size is set to twelve pixels. Again: attributes everywhere!</p>

<p>ID and CLASS attributes help indentify and group HTML elements for HTML-transcending use cases. CLASS TAGS are all about grouping TAGS together with the same semantics to STYLE them.</p>

<p>Honestly, so-called internal STYLING/ selective configuration of appearance is just <i>inline styling somewhere else: In the document or in a reference document.</i></p>
