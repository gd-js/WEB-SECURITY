# Paradigms and more

## Standard Programming Paradigm

Interpreted Programming Language (gets send to compiled like C)  
1. Imperative (structured, procedural (object oriented, event driven, modular))  
2. Declarative (functional, first-oder logic, higher-order logic)  

Compiled Programming Language (gets send to compiler with some assembly)
1. Imperative (structured, procedural (object oriented, event driven, modular))
2. Declarative (functional, first-oder logic, higher-order logic)

SOLID  
1. **S** There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. (Single-Responsibility)
2. **O** Open for extension but closed for modification. (Open-Closed)  
3. **L** Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it. (Liskov substitution)  
4. **O** Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. (Interface-Segregation)  
5. **D** Depend upon abstractions, do not depend on concretions. (Dependency-Inversion)  

ACID  
1. **A** Fail entirely or do not fail. (Atomicity)  
2. **C** Roll back if not consistent according to preset rules. (Consistency)
3. **I** Atoms connot conflict with each other. (Isolation)
4. **D** No log is ever lost and can be used to reinstate everything. (Durability)

SOA
